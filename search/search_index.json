Node Node is server that runs evade84-node instance. Anyone in the world can run evade84 node (even you, little pickle)! Every node has name . Node owner may call his or her node as he likes. Pool Pool is something like chat-room or chat in Telegram. It contains messages sent by users. Every pool has a unique address (which is literally a hex value of pools uuid4 ). Also, pool may optionally have a tag . It is a unique readable identifier (e.g. my-blog123 ). It can be used to link any specific pool as well as pool address . Pool tag and pool address are called pool identifier . Pool metadata Pool may have some metadata: Description (optional, mutable) - description of pool Creator signature (optional immutable) - signature of the pool creator Creation date (required, immutable) - date of pool creation Encryption info (required, immutable) - information about pool encryption Publicity (required, immutable) - information about pool publicity Pool types Pool must be one of the following types: Type Who can write messages Who can read messages Who can manage pool AES Encryption wall anyone anyone master-key owner no chat writer-key owner reader-key owner master-key owner optional channel writer-key owner anyone master-key owner no mailbox anyone reader-key owner master-key owner no wall is like a real wall - anyone can read from it and write anything on it! chat is like a private dialog - only participants have access to it. It also may be encrypted! channel is like a TV, Telegram or YouTube channel - anyone can read and watch it, but only a few people with access can provide content! mailbox is like a real mailbox (I mean box with a small hole for letters and lock on it) - anyone can throw letter into it, only key owners are able to open it and read messages! Pool access keys Access to pool is managed via access keys . There are three different types of them: master-key is present in pools of any type. It provides access to editing (including keys) and deleting pool. writer-key provides access to writing messages in pools. reader-key provides access to reading messages in pools. Pool, depending on its type has writer-key and/or reader-key . But it always has a master-key . Message Message is... well... a message! Pools contains list of messages. Messages may optionally have authors signature and may be optionally encrypted using AES . Every message has id - serial number of the message in specific pool. Signature Signature is used to authorize users. It is something that proves, that action was performed by the specific user. Anyone can create as many signatures as needed. Moreover, signature is optional, you may stay fully anonymous if you wish! Signature has value - name or pseudonym (may be not unique) and uuid - unique identifier. Pool identifier and signature identifier are different things. Pool identifier means pool tag or pool address , when signature identifier means certain string which is unique and used to identify signature. Signature metadata Signatures also have some metadata: Description (optional, mutable) - description of signature. Creation date (required, immutable) - date when signature was created. Signature access key Signature access is managed using signature access key . Anyone who owns this key is able to sign his/her messages or created pools with specific signature; edit signature description. Deleting signature Signature cannot be deleted.","title":"Basic definitions"},{"location":"getting-started/basic-definitions/#basic-definitions","text":"The article contains important terms for understanding the system.","title":"Basic definitions"},{"location":"getting-started/basic-definitions/#node","text":"Node is server that runs evade84-node instance.
